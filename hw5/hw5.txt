1. Exception Table
0 | 0xC0015200

2. Program pointer %eip points to 0x08031000.
In CPU, ALU circuit recognizes %ebx == 0 and fetches exc[0].
Exc[0] is address 0xC0015200, which is where the first
  instruction of dividebyZero is located in memory.
CPU executes the instruction at 0xC0015200, which is the 
  first instruction of dividebyZero.
