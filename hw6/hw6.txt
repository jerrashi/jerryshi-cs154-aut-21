Part A:
1. P - 16, forkret = 0
2. P - 23, forkret = 102
3. C - 19, forkret = 0
4. P - 8, forkret = 102
5. C - 8, forkret = 0
6. C - 10, forkret = 0
7. P - 26, forkret = 102

Part B:
1. P - 16, forkret = 0
2. P - 23, forkret = 102
3. C - 19, forkret = 0
4. C - 8, forkret = 0
5. C - 10, forkret = 0
6. P - 26, forkret = 102
Lines 20 and 24 are in a race. Line 24 runs first, leading to this output.

Part C:
1. P - 16, forkret = 0
2. P - 23, forkret = 102
3. C - 8, forkret = 0
4. C - 10, forkret = 0
5. P - 26, forkret = 0
Lines 24 and 19 are in a race. Line 24 runs first, leading to this output.

Part D:
1. P - 16, forkret = 0
2. C - 19, forkret = 0
3. P - 8, forkret = 0
4. P - 10, forkret = 0
Parent process is interrupted in the middle of line 18 after fork returns, and lines 8-11 (signal handler) run before forkret is assigned a value.
