PART 1:
A. A memory leak of 5,000 bytes is created. For every client (100 in this case), the
   parent process will open a file descriptor table but not close it after the
   client is serviced.
B. No memory leak. The parent process points to the same listenfd table each time.
   There is a slight performance impact since the child process doesn't close the
   pointer to listenfd in the fd table.
