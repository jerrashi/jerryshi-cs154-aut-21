A) Miss Rate is 100%. x[0][i] & x[1][i] will point to same block, causing
 a conflict miss for all queries.
B) Miss Rate is 25%. Now the array is large enough to avoid conflict misses.
 We will still have cold/compulsory misses for the first hit on a block.
 Each block is four words, so the miss rate will be (1 - hit rate) = 1 - 3/4 = 1/4.
C) Now that there are two blocks per set, we no longer have conflict misses.
 Thus, again the miss rate is (1 - hit rate) = 1 - 3/4 = 1/4. 
D) No, the larger cache size makes no difference because all the misses are cold misses.
 Cold misses are compulsory in the beginning to load in data.
E) Yes, the larger block size decreaes the miss rate from cold misses since more words
 can be stored in each block.
